=== Development


* System dependencies (Ubuntu package names)

  * build-essential

  * curl

  * postgresql-server-dev-9.1

* Unpacked dependecies

  * PhantomJS >= 1.9.2 (http://phantomjs.org/)

  *NOTE:* Just create sym links for that

    cd /usr/local/share
    wget http://phantomjs.googlecode.com/files/phantomjs-1.9.2-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2
    tar xjf phantomjs-1.9.2-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/phantomjs-1.9.2-linux-x86_64/bin/phantomjs /usr/local/share/phantomjs
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/phantomjs-1.9.2-linux-x86_64/bin/phantomjs /usr/local/bin/phantomjs
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/phantomjs-1.9.2-linux-x86_64/bin/phantomjs /usr/bin/phantomjs

* Ruby version

  2.1.1

  You can easily install it through the Ruby Version Manager - RVM. Instructions on how to do it can be found at http://rvm.io

  *NOTE:* If you are using the gnome-shell, or any derivate like terminator, you have to mark on your profile the option to use a "login bash".


* Configuration

    bundle install

* Database creation

    rake db:create

* Database initialization

    rake db:setup

* How to run the test suite

    rake

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

  Kalibro Web Service 1.0 r6
  You can find a script to install it on Ubuntu at https://gist.github.com/rafamanzo/6179925/91908b8f1fe291db0ae90a3b6998f5fbb1fa671a (if you're brave https://gist.github.com/rafamanzo/6179925/ shows a unstable script with JBoss instead of Tomcat)

  Kalibro Gatekeeper
  You can find a script to install it on any machine with Rails on https://gist.github.com/rafamanzo/9859244. After running this script, run ```unset BUNDLE_GEMFILE```.
  By default Mezuro will expect it to be running on port 8081 at localhost.
  In order to run it as expected, run: ```rails s -p 8081```.

* Deployment instructions

  Deployment is made through Capistano (https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano)

    cap production deploy

  In order to do this, you must have the password.

  Otherwise, you can also modify the deployment file at <tt>config/deploy.rb</tt>.

=== Install

* First Deploy

  1. Make sure that the deployment file <tt>config/deploy.rb</tt> is correctly configured to the installation server;
  2. Also, make sure that the installation server already has rvm installed;
  3. <tt>cap deploy:setup</tt> will install the ruby correct ruby version, the gemset and all the directories tree;
  4. <tt>cap deploy:migrations</tt> deploys the code and run all the migrations
